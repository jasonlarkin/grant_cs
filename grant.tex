The new population needs to be introduced to computational tools quickly and efficiently.  
The new population also needs to learn the fundamentals of computation. The right balance 
must be struck between tools that have been abstraced away from the .








A Virtual Machine can be made immutable . There can always be an original copy 
of the machine's exact state of hardware and software.

A Virtual Machine is usable by anyone who has been given secure access, anywhere there 
is an internet connection. (this is pretty much everywhere, and growing exponentially).

A Virtual Development Envinronment allows anyone with secure access 
.

Critical design aspects can be communicated instantly.  

Can reduce

Cloud service hardware is some of the most secure computing systems in the world. 
Fortune 500 companies (Google, Amazon, etc) invest billions of $ into the design 
of their advanced computing systems.
